### Getting started 
#### Installation 
You can install all the dependencies by running:

    pip install -r requirement.txt 

The program runs well with python 3.7 and tkinter 8.6, sometimes mysterious features arise when different version of tkinter and python is used.  

#### How to start the server
The servers main script can be started with:
    
    python teamserver/server.py
  
The default port is 54000. You can start the server on another port, for instance 54006, with the command:

    python teamserver/server.py -p 54006

Furthermore, you can enable the log feature with the command:

    python teamserver/server.py -l 1
    
You can look into these options with the command:
    
    python teamserver/server.py -h  
    
#### How to start the client
The client can either be started with the CLI (Command line interface) with 

    python teamclient/lobby_client.py
    
or with a GUI (graphical user interface): 
    
    python teamclient/lobbyGUI.py
  
lobby_client.py comes with a few argparse options, in which you can choose the ip address, the port number and enable or disable the broadcast feature if needed during the interoperability tests.
For example, you can connect with a server on the LKN-Server on port 54006 by using:

    python teamclient/lobby_client.py -ip 129.187.223.130 -p 54006 
    
Broadcast is enabled (1) by default. You can disable it by adding -b 0:

    python teamclient/lobby_client.py -b 0
    
The default value of (ip, port) is (localhost, 54000). 
You can also look into these options with the command:
    
    python teamclient/lobby_client.py -h  

In case you run the GUI, the argparse options are all integrated into the GUI. Everything else should be self explaining.
